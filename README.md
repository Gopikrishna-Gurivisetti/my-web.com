# My Project

This is a simple HTML/CSS website for "Eduford," a fictional university. It showcases various sections like the header, courses offered, global campus locations, facilities, student testimonials, a call to action, and a footer with social media icons. Below is a brief explanation of each section and its contents:

## Sections

### 1. Header section
- Contains the university logo and name, along with a navigation menu that links to different sections of the website.
- It displays a marquee with the text "World's Biggest University" and a brief introduction about the university.

### 2. Courses
- Presents the courses offered by Eduford University, categorized into Undergraduate, Graduate, and Post Graduation programs.
- Each category has a description of the programs offered.

### 3. Global Campus
- Highlights the university's campuses in different cities (London, New York, and Washington).
- Each campus is represented by an image and the city name.

### 4. Facilities
- Showcases various facilities provided by the university, such as the library, playground, and cafeteria.
- Each facility is accompanied by a relevant image and a brief description.

### 5. Testimonials
- Includes testimonials from two students, along with their images and ratings.

### 6. Call To Action
- Encourages visitors to enroll in online courses and provides a "Contact Us" button.

### 7. Footer
- Contains information about Eduford University and social media icons for various platforms.
- It also credits the website creator with a heart symbol and their name.

## External Resources

- The website uses Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- It also links to the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts and includes the "Font Awesome" CSS for the social media icons.

## JavaScript

The script in the `script` tag provides functionality to the navigation menu. When the menu icon (three horizontal bars) is clicked, it shows the navigation links, and when the close icon (times symbol) is clicked, it hides the navigation links.

Please note that this is just an HTML/CSS skeleton of a website and lacks real content or server-side functionality.
